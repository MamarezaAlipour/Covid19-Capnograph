# COVID-19 Capnograph

Capnography includes the noninvasive measurement of CO2, providing information on ventilation, perfusion, and metabolism in intubated and spontaneously breathing patients. Since the 1990s, capnography has been utilized extensively for cardiac arrest and procedural sedation. Qualitative capnography includes a colorimetric device, changing color on the amount of CO2 present. Quantitative capnography provides a numeric value (end-tidal CO2), and capnography most commonly includes a waveform as a function of time. Conditions in which capnography is informative include cardiac arrest, procedural sedation, mechanically ventilated patients, and patients with metabolic acidemia. Patients with seizure, trauma, and respiratory conditions, such as pulmonary embolism and obstructive airway disease, can benefit from capnography, but further study is needed. Limitations include use of capnography in conditions with mixed pathophysiology, patients with low tidal volumes, and equipment malfunction. Capnography should be used in conjunction with clinical assessment.

This project implements an open-source, cheap and quick to manufacture alternative to comercial capnographs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
